IOT Week 2 Tasks

This is the README file of week 2 tasks which is creating an arm control panel using html.
You will find in the folder:
1- The html code for the arm control.
2- A screen shot of the database I created using phpMyAdmin.
3- The php page that I created.

But I had a problem regarding connecting the html page with the database!
every time I try to run my page so the data can be stored in the database, the php code that I created appears in the browser.
I tried every thing I have found online but nothing seems to work for me.
If i could get help regarding this issue that would be great.

Thanks for reading,
