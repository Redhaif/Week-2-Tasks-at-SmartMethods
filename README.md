IOT Week 2 Tasks <br />

This is the README file of week 2 tasks which is creating an arm control panel using html. <br />
You will find in the folder: <br />
1- The html code for the arm control. <br />
2- A screen shot of the database I created using phpMyAdmin. <br />
3- The php page that I created. <br />

But I had a problem regarding connecting the html page with the database! <br />
every time I try to run my page so the data can be stored in the database, the php code that I created appears in the browser. <br />
I tried every thing I have found online but nothing seems to work for me. <br />
If i could get help regarding this issue that would be great. <br />

Thanks for reading, <br />

=============================================================================================== <br />
 I updated the Week 2 Tasks. <br />
 Link to the website: https://first-firebase-project-3e7af.web.app/ <br />
 
 The file now contains: <br />
 1- The Arm slider control html file. <br />
 2- Robot arm movement control html. <br />
 3- IBM Watson chatbot.
 
 The main change is that I used firebase database instead of phpMyadmin. <br />
