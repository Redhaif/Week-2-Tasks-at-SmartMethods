IOT Week 2 Tasks <pre>

This is the README file of week 2 tasks which is creating an arm control panel using html. <pre>
You will find in the folder: <pre>
1- The html code for the arm control. <pre>
2- A screen shot of the database I created using phpMyAdmin. <pre>
3- The php page that I created. <pre>

But I had a problem regarding connecting the html page with the database! <pre>
every time I try to run my page so the data can be stored in the database, the php code that I created appears in the browser. <pre>
I tried every thing I have found online but nothing seems to work for me. <pre>
If i could get help regarding this issue that would be great. <pre>

Thanks for reading, <pre>
